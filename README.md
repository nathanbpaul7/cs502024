This represents the breadth of my coursework completed for CS50, including all problem sets and additional explorations.

I'm excited to apply my understanding to a final project where I build a dynamic web app, venturing out of python/flask for server/database integration and familiarizing myself with node, next.js, React, and how to route/handle server side requests using javascript.
