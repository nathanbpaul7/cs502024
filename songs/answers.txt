If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

I'd characterize it as a "purple" aura because they have the highest average in danceability, followed by energy.
This sounds like someone who likes music that make the move and groove.  According to Mystic Michaela, that would land
them in the purple aura.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

Well its inferring a lot about people's use of the app, first and foremost.  I personally use spotify to play music not only for myself,
but often for others or to curate a vibe in a particular place.  It's possible that the top 100 songs do not represent a personal selection,
but rather a selection for others.  Also, there are far more factors that create mood from music besides energy, danceability, and valence (happiness factor).
Lyrical content can be a huge determining factor in why someone chooses to listen to a song, regardless of the musical components around those lyrics.
It seems super reductive to me to try and assign overall moods or intentions to a user's interaction with music that purport to be deterministic.
